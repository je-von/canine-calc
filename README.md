How many calories and gram of foods should I feed my dog daily? Am I overfeeding / underfeeding my dog? How heavy should my dog be? What's their ideal weight? Those are the questions dog's owners have that will be answered in this app!

_This playground app was created to raise awareness about the importance of dog‚Äôs daily nutrient needs and how overfeeding and underfeeding your dogs can be a matter of life and death._
